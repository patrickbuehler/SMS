### SMS is a project for Yale's CPSC 112: Introduction to Programming class. 
SMS is an Android application that automatically sends text messages at a certain time.
The project was never completed, largely because no team member had an Android phone with which we could test the code.

It was my first experience working with a team of people to create a programming project.
